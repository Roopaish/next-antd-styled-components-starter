# Next Antd Styled-Components Starter using the App directory

## Includes

- Reusable UI components and theming
- Theming and SSR support using styled-components and antd

## TODO

[ ] Eslint and prettier configuration

## Notes

- When using styled-component, mark the file with `'use client'`
- Always use `shouldNotForwardPropsWithKeys` (/lib/styled.ts), to avoid styled components custom props to end up in the DOM
- Follow the structure as it is now
